- A polyfill for react-navigation to make web feel like native when it comes to navigation.

> It could be unnecesary and deprecated in the near future when in `react-navigation` bring support to built in views for web.

## Motivation

It brings all behaviors from the [built-in](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/) views of [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) from the native to the web.

## Quick start

 - Install dependency

```
npm i --save react-navigation react-navigation-polyfill
```

 - Resolve alias in webpack

```javascript
{
  // other webpack config
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "react-navigation": "react-navigation-polyfill"
    }
  }
```
 - Navigate!

## Navigators

### DrawerNavigator

 [DrawerNavigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/drawer) can't be used on web, instead this polyfill is wrapping the native one.

### TabNavigator

 [TabNavigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/tab) can't be used on web, instead this polyfill is wrapping the native one.

### StackNavigator

[StackNavigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/stack) can't be used on web, instead this polyfill is wrapping the native one.

## About

This module is meant somehow as a solution to follow discussions from 
[react-navigation](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view/issues/159) and [react-native-tab-view](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view/issues/159) and because so far it is the way to make native navigators work on web.
